# Where's Waldo Game

[Live Demo](https://ren0xx.github.io/Where-is-Waldo/) :point_left:

## Built with

-   [React](https://reactjs.org/)

-   [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/)
-   [Material UI](https://mui.com/)
-   [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)

I used Firebase as BaaS for this project. It is a really powerful and beginner friendly 'tool'.

Creating an account is quite simple - you have to do that in order to play the game.

At this point, you can only play one board.
